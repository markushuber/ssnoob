# Create a social snapshot of your Facebook account

The precompiled SSNOOB jar file runs on Windows, MacOS, and Linux and requires a [Java runtime environment (Version 1.7 or higher)](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).
Start the SSNOOB applications and start the download process:
### Using an existing Facebook browser session (also useful for forensics)
If you are logged into Facebook on Facebook on Internet Explorer, Chrome, or Firefox SSNOOB should automatically detect the running session (MacOS is currently not supported). Select the browser you usually use with Facebook and click Login with cookies.
Click on **"Login with cookies"**.
### Login with username and password
Enter your Facebook username and password and click on **"Login using credentials"**.

**Depending on your Facebook account and your Internet connection the download process might take a while**.

# Which information do you get with SSNOOB?

## Account content (JSON)
The content of your useraccount is stored in a single JSON file with the following format: `userid_timestamp_socialsnapshot.json` (e.g. `123456789_2014-08-19_07-22-23_socialsnapshot.json`).

## Images (Photos)
SSNOOB creates two different image directories (If download images is actived): `userid-images` and `userid-user-images`. The first directory contains the actual HTTP path to the downloaded pictures, while the second directory lists Photos by Facebook user.

# FAQ

## Are you storing any of my user information?
SSNOOB downloads your account data locally, we do not store or access the API oAuth token. Also the SSNOOB Facebook application is automatically removed from your Facebook account once the download process has finished.

## How do I build SSNOOB from source?

### Requirements
* [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/)
* [Java 7](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html)

### Clone this git repository.

### Build jar packages
Run `mvn package` within the SSNOOB directory. Maven will create a folder called *target* which contains two jar files: one with all library dependencies and one without libraries.
